Rapido Clone

This project is a clone of the Rapido website, created with enhanced features and a responsive design. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It is intended for educational purposes only.

Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap

In the future, I plan to implement dynamic functionality to further improve the project and make it more interactive and feature-rich.
